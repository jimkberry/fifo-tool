    "#### Record types\n",
    "\n",
    "What we are interested in here are:\n",
    "- BTC/ETH \"Receive\" - Receipt of new crypto (income) as an Acquisition - tho maybe also just a transfer into CB before a sale in cbrpo? One tip is that even-numbered values from an ext acct are probably from me.\n",
    "- BTC/ETH \"Withdrawl\" - implicit CB-assisted sale as a Disposition\n",
    "- BTC/ETH \"Send\" - maybe a payment (Disposition) or maybe just a transfer out of CB, which isn;t a disposition. We can't know so it gets exported as a disp and you have to decide in FIFO-toll what to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Less directly interesting (we don;t do anything with them) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- BTC/ETH \"Exchange Deposit\" - Crypto being sent to CBPro/GDAX - almost certainly to be sold - not exported\n",
    "- USD \"Exchange withdrawal\" - almost always right after the BTC Exchange deposit - is the cash from the sale - not exported\n",
    "- USD \"Withdrawal\" - usually the same amount as the exchange withdrawal, and right after it: the money being transferred to a bank - not exported\n",
    "\n",
    "...And there are new ones\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pro Deposit/Withdrawal - at some point in 2018 \"Pro\" deposits and withdrawal appeared. I think they are the same a \"Exchange\" ones? There are reports that have both - I'm just assuming they mean the same thing. We still don;t process them.\n",
    "- Buy - buy an asset on CB. *Acquisition*.\n",
    "- Convert - \"Convert\" an asset to another or cash - like \"USD\", which is just a sale. *Disposition* (unless the asset is the \"Price currency\" - but I'll bet that never happens. For now we'll check and makes sure it's ASSET -> USD and blow up otherwise.\n",
    "- Reward Income - Yikes! Ignore.\n",
    "- Advanced Trade Sell - GDAX/PRO is now \"Advanced\"?  *Disposition*. This is not reflected in the year's PRO Account report, so there's no chance of duplication\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fees\n",
    "\n",
    "Fees are reported inconsistently negative or positive for different transaction types. There's probably a ryhme or reason, but it seems to me that\n",
    "all fees are payed by the user, so should be consistent. I choose positive\n",
    "\n",
    "| Record |  Sign  | Example      |\n",
    "|-----|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Buy | Positive | (Fee: 3.67) |\n",
    "| Convert | Positive | (Fee: 3.5497) |\n",
    "| Withdrawal | Negative | (Fee: -94.06) |\n",
    "| Advanced Trade Sell | Negative | (Fee: -7.014658035216) |\n",
    "| Advanced Trade Sell | Positive | (Fee: 13.9426) |\n",
    "\n",
    "WTF? Looks like the Advanced Trade Sell records in 2023 reported negative fees, positive thereafter?\n",
    "A: Actually, the report in 2023 was inconsistent with other reports. A BTC \"Withdrawal\" in 2015 was also reported with negative fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are just using the asset amount, asset price, and fees columns, so everything works out as long as we always call fees positive and subtract them\n",
    "from amoutn*price to get net proceeds/cost\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by assuming \"receive\" is an acq, and \"send' and an asset \"withdrawl\" are always dispositions\n",
    "\n",
    "Now also process \"Buy\", \"Convert\", \"Advanced Sell Trade\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I guess we should flag anything unrecognized or unexpected. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about other assets? like an ETH tx when we are processing BTC. Shoudl we at least log it? Not doing it ATM\n",
    "\n",
    "Also - just as an aside - the records in these TX statements are ordered newest to oldest... which is weird.\n"
